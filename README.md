# Janki

**tl;dr**: Search [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org/) for vocabulary and add it to your [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) collection with the press of a button.

Janki allows to quickly search Jisho.org for vocabulary and add relevant results to an existing Anki collection.
The aim of this package is to reduce user input to a minimum: After linking the Jisho search result fields to the fields of your Anki Model, all there's left to do is search for a word, and hit a single button to add it.
