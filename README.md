# Janki

Search [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org/) for vocabulary and add it to your [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) collection with the press of a button (maybe two presses).

Janki allows to quickly search Jisho.org for vocabulary and add relevant results to an existing Anki collection.
The aim of this package is to reduce user input to a minimum: After linking the Jisho search result fields to the fields of your Anki Model, all there's left to do is search for a word, and hit a single button to add it.
